<h2>Digital Humanities Project Registry</h2>

<p>
	This is the BETA version of the Digital Humanities Project Registry 
	that offers an overview of performances in the field of DH in the Netherlands. 
	The resource has been created on the basis of DARIAH source code. 
	This has been deposited in Github at â€¦.

<p>
	The information on projects is derived from the 
	<?php echo $this->Html->link('NARCIS database', 
		'http://www.narcis.nl/',

		'http://www.clariah.nl',
		array('target' => 'blank')
	); ?>
	project financed by NWO.
