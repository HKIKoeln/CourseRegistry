Over the years though and with more and more participants contributing their requirements and ideas, it developed a different agenda. On the one hand, Collate is a complete solution for producing a critical apparatus, with features ranging from its very own algorithm for comparing versions of a text to a powerful graphical user interface that lets the user control the collation process. On the other hand, CollateX has become a software component which can be embedded into other software or be made a part of a software system. Its goal is the provision and advancement of current research in the field of computer-supported collation involving natural language texts.

Central to this qualitative research programme is the notion that digital cartographies allow a greater degree of two-way interaction between map and user than analogue maps do. Digital map users are not just reading maps, but also constantly influence the shape and look of the map itself. At home, at work and while travelling: maps have become more personal, transforming while we navigate with and through them. Digital maps have thus altered our conception of maps as ‘objectified’ representations of space that has been a touchstone for centuries (Anderson 1999, De Certeau 1984, Crampton 2001, Harley 1988, Mukerji 1989, Wood 2002).

The acting style is assumed to have changed as well: while the classical tragedy was predominantly a language art, in bourgeois tragedy, the emotions were best expressed through the body.

These methods delivers distances between dialects. On the basis of these distances the dialects can be classified. Therefore, at the same time several methods for classification are researched. This project will try to give an answer to the following dialectological question: in which way do we get the most reliable dialect classification? In 1988 Hoppenbrouwers presented his feature frequency method. In 1995 Kessler used Levenshtein distance for comparing Irish dialects. Later, Levenshtein distance was used for Dutch dialects by Nerbonne et al. (1996) and Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997). The results were promising. An intermediate form is the word per frequency method. Per word, the frequencies of phones or features of phones are counted. Dialects are compared by comparing their frequencies. In this research, the Levensthein distance will be refined and elaborated. As in previous research, the dialects will be classified by clustering (Jain and Dubes, 1988), multidimensional scaling (Kruskal and Wish, 1978) and Indscale (Kruskal and Wish, 1978). With these methods results are readily obtained. To get an indication of the reliability, results are compared with traditional and experimental dialectology. For comparison with the results of the traditional dialectology several dialect maps will be used. For Dutch dialects, the maps of Te Winkel, van Ginneken, Weijnen, Daan (Daan and Blok, 1969) are employed. If available, English or American dialect maps will also be used. For comparison with experimental dialectology, a recording of a number of dialect fragments is constructed. Test persons listen to the tape, where each test person expresses the difference with respect to a standard language in a number (Van Hout en Münstermann, 1981, Gooskens, 1997).

This work addresses the following problems: (i) which criteria determine that an expression in language use has to be described as a fixed expression, (ii) how (automatic) identification models can capture such criteria and (iii) how to predict whether such expressions allow variation and modification. The properties and the behavior of fixed expressions are still poorly understood. The type and number of irregularities vary across expressions. The author argues that the idiosyncratic behavior affecting one or more levels of linguistic analysis suffices to establish that an expression qualifies as a fixed expression. To identify fixed expressions, Villada Moirón proposes the use of hybrid models that combine statistics and linguistic nowledge. In order to be successful, the identification models need to capture irregularities that affect the morphology, syntactic distribution and meaning, in addition to the lexical associations between the word components. To establish the potential for variation and modification, a corpus-based method extracts relevant evidence from anannotated corpus. The evidence allows us distinguish various types of support verb constructions. Villada Moiron observes that the presence of certain determiner changes correlate with a potential for modification, albeit less than perfectly. The methods need to be tested further with other types of fixed expressions but it seems that their design features are appropriate for the task. Such methods are crucial to improve the description of fixed expressions in lexical and computational resources.', 1, 1, '2000-11-01', '2005-03-01', NULL, NULL, NULL),

Voorbeelden zijn respectievelijk ‘audio puellam venire’ (ik hoor dat het meisje komt) en ‘audio puellam venientem’ (ik hoor het meisje komen). Promovendus Susanne Schoof onderzocht beide structuren vanuit een syntactisch en semantisch gezichtspunt. Omdat Latijn een dode taal is, is het niet altijd eenvoudig te beoordelen of een bepaalde structuur grammaticaal correct is of niet. Voor iedere voorbeeldzin in het onderzoek moest Schoof derhalve een bewijsplaats vinden in de Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina, het grootste en volledigste elektronisch beschikbare corpus. Zij concludeert dat zowel de accusativus cum infinitivo als de accusativus cum participio twee structuren kent en stelt daarom voor beide te subcategoriseren.

Bron: Rug nieuws 6/12/2004\n\nMany school students have struggled during the Latin grammar lesson: the \'accusative and infinitive (ACI) and the\' accusative cum participio (ACP). Examples are respectively "audio puellam venire \'(I hear that\'s the girl) and" audio puellam venientem (I hear come the girl). PhD student Susanne Sheaf studied both structures from a syntactic and semantic point of view. Because Latin is a dead language, it is not always easy to judge whether a given structure is grammatically correct or not. For each example sentence in the study Schoof therefore had to find proof place at the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina, the largest and most complete available electronic corpus. It concludes that both the accusative and infinitive as accusative cum participio two structures has therefore proposes subcategoriseren both.

The focus will be on dialogues where spoken language is one of the in- or output modalities. In 2000 we hope to address the following issues:\n(1) Memory-based spotting of communication errors. One of the major problems with the current generation of spoken dialogue systems is that they are insufficiently able to monitor the status of the ongoing conversation. In the past year, we (Krahmer, Swerts, Theune and Weegels) have worked on error-spotting in human-machine communication. This work has shown that humans signal errors using a number of cues (e.g., marked intonation, longer utterances, disconfirmations, repetitions, marked word-order, etc.). A dialogue system which is able to spot such cues automatically might be better able to signal and respond to errors. We would like to investigate to what extent the various cues can be detected automatically from a word-graph (the output of a speech recognition engine).\n(2) Changing modalities to solve errors. Of course spotting errors is one thing, solving them is quite another. It seems that one promising way to solve errors is by changing modalities. For instance, presenting visual feedback and allowing for users to select an object via a different modality than speech (e.g., touch) may help in solving problems.\n(3) Generating descriptions in multi-modal contexts. Beun and Cremers have investigated the way humans refer to objects in multi-modal contexts. It seems that the algorithms developed by Krahmer and Theune for the generation of descriptions are very well-suited to model the findings of Beun and Cremers regarding human behaviour.', 0, 0, '2000-01-01', '2003-09-01', NULL, NULL, NULL),

The project explores a combination of three possible solutions.\n(1) Use semantic information such as implied in lexical networks or statistical language models for disambiguation of syntactic ambiguities.\n(2) For remaining ambiguities: apply a data-oriented approach, i.e. choose the most frequent analysis given a corpus as the best candidate parse; this means that we make mistakes only for the less frequent cases.\n(3) Do so only if this choice will not raise comprehension cost to unacceptable levels for the less frequent cases, i.e. apply the data-oriented approach in an intelligent way, taking the comprehension cost associated with the different options into consideration. This requires perception experiments to estimate the comprehension cost of prosodic errors.

Cultural musicology, which integrates methods and approaches from (new) ethnomusicology, the anthropology of music and new musicology, can be understood both as the cultural analysis of music and the musical analysis of culture. The Music and Culture research project contributes to the ASCA constellations Globalization, Identities and Mediality. Studying music in its cultural frames on a potentially world wide scale and focusing on the present and its recent history necessarily brings with it a distinctly postcolonial perspective. European music was propagated in large parts of the world, sometimes eradicating indigenous music, in other cases leading to hybridizations and generating new forms. But contemporary ‘musickers’ around the world, in both classical and popular traditions, also have engaged with ‘Other’ music on a large scale. As such, musical ideas travelled and created new meanings, much like the Travelling Concepts of Mieke Bal. In cultural musicology music has often been studied as a means of identity construction. It is rather obvious that Irish and Polish people around the world revel in making (imagined and invented) music that furnishes them with a cultural comfort zone. But how are identities constructed in a cultural in-between? As a corollary of the postcolonial cultural flows and hybridization the emergence of new identities in music is a second focus of music and culture. Finally, music is necessarily mediated, primarily through the musicker (including the listener and his body), and secondly through all sorts of records; written scores, wax cylinders, shellac discs, radio, LPRs, magnetic tapes and cassettes, television, CDs and the internet. In the twenty-first century music cultures heavily rely on these technologies and many new music cultures depend entirely on them, existing without a live counterpart. Summarizing, the project Music and Culture investigates the interactions and negotiations of local and global cultural flows, paying special attention to the construction of identities and the mediation of hybridizing processes leading to the emergence of new meanings in new world hearings as a result of music’s travels. The project draws on a large variety of methodologies, among them live research, historical methods, music theory, musical practice, acoustics, physics, performance and digital humanities. As such it relates to the three priority areas of Humanities research at Amsterdam University. Understanding world hearings, knowing culture through music, cannot be realized through a confined Eurocentric approach that was the hallmark of comparative musicology and largely also ethnomusicology. The different ‘musico-logicas’ of the world therefore play a salient role in cultural musicology. Analyzing music around the world with the tools of European musicology, with its heavy reliance on transcriptions in staff-notation simply will not do. Not only must indigenous methodologies be applied, but in addition the development of new methods of analysis through negotiations between music cultures are necessary.', 0, 0, '2013-02-01', '2017', NULL, NULL, NULL),

All speakers read numbers, frequent utterances, semantically unpredictable sentences and phonetically rich sentences. For recognition a standard phone-based CSR was used. Results of the recognition experiments were presented as word error rates, i.e. the number of substitutions, insertions and deletions dived by the total number of words. Performance of the CSR was tested by using speaker independent models, speaker dependent models (using a jack-knife procedure) and by extending the size of the lexicon and the amount of training material. - Results: Word error rates ranged from 4.5% to 41.0% for dysarthric speech that is recognised with the CSR trained on non-dysarthric speech. Relative large improvements were found (50% to 100%) when the CSR was trained on speech of the dysarthric speakers.

First, we will explore how audiovisual prosody can be exploited to highlight the information status of words. Then, we will investigate how it can be used to signal whether or not the process of information exchange in a dialogue is going well. Next, we will explore how it can support the turn-taking mechanism in spontaneous interactions. Finally, we will see to what extent audiovisual prosody may reflect speakers emotions and attitudes. The results of these different substudies will be integrated in one coherent, functional model of audiovisual prosody. All the questions will be tackled from the point of view of both the speaker and the listener, and from a crosslinguistic perspective. Insight into functional aspects of audiovisual prosody is relevant from both a theoretical and applied perspective. First, it is remarkable to observe that this important communicative device is still largely unexplored. Knowledge about how audiovisual prosody works may yield new insights into how people mark important words, deixis, turn-taking, discourse structure, etc. and more general into how languages can differ in the way they signal linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena. Second, there is an increasing interest in computer interfaces that rely on what is termed embodied conversational agents , i.e., specific software components that appear to users as animated characters.

Therefore, such expressions and their unpredictable properties must be stored in a lexicon. Examples of multi-word expressions are idioms (e.g. to kick the bucket, with unpredictable meaning \'to die\'), support-verb constructions (e.g. Dutch \'een poging wagen\', where the selection of the verb \'wagen\' is specific to the noun \'poging\'), compounds in certain languages (e.g. English), multi-word terms from specific domains (e.g. English \'part of speech\', Dutch translation = \'woordsoort\'), etc. State-of- the-Art systems that process natural language automatically (\'NLP-systems\', e.g. machine translaton systems, information retrieval systems, information exraction systems, question-answering systems, etc.) do not deal adequately with large numbers of multi-word expressions. NLP-systems can only be deployed successfully if they can handle such multi-word expressions adequately, and in addition there should be methods to rapidly include new multi-word expresssions in a NLP-system. Many NLP-systems (e.g. Machine translation) operate most successfully if they operate in a restricted domain. But each specific domain has its own multi-word terminology, which usually is not included in generic NLP-systems, so it must be possible to rapidly tune a generic NLP-system to a specific domain. This forms a major obstacle for the successful application of NLP technologies (Sag et al., 2001) in domains such as information retrieval (Thurmair, 2003) and summarization, question answering (Dowdall et al., 2003) and machine translation (Odijk 2000). The Dutch NOTaS group (http://www.stichtingnotas.nl/), a conglomerate of commercial and academic NLP-developers points out that a proper treatment of MWEs is of great importance, e.g. in the processing industries (Akkermans et al., 2004, p.118). The current work in many research institutions is too much focused on work concerning the individual head words only, and on general rather than domain specific language. They also point out, in a more general context, the need for standards. Van Dale Data also considers this a significant problem, and is prepared to materially support the current proposal by providing data sets to facilitate the research. Many (though not all) NLP-systems have methods to deal with multi-word expressions. However, these methods require that very rich and detailed information is included in the lexical item for each multi-word expression. As a consequence, the lexicons of these systems usually contain only a limited number of multi-word expressions. In addition, each system has its own approach to such expressions, uses its own grammatical framework and grammatical theory, and has details of implementation that are specific to that system. This results in the unfortunate situation that a lexical entry for a multi-word expression made for one particular system cannot be directly used in other systems. The research proposal focuses on the so-called Equivalence Class Method (ECM) for the standard lexical representation of MWEs recently developed by (Odijk, 2003a), see also (Odijk, 2003b; Odijk, 2004a; Odijk, 2004b). The ECM offers an innovative methodology in this domain and contributes to solving this problem (1) by presenting a method for a standardized way of lexically representing multi-word expressions that is technically simple and highly independent of specific grammatical frameworks, grammatic theories, and their implementations; and (2) by presenting a method on how to derive a system-specific representation from this standardized representation in a highly automated manner. The combination of these two ingredients makes it possible to describe multi-word expressions without all the rich and detailed information required in any specific system, and it makes it possible to reuse such lexical descriptions in a wide variety of NLP-systems. In the research project the proposed method will be further elaborated, empirically tested, and extended to cover other types of MWEs than flexible idioms.', 0, 0, '2004-01-01', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Het voorbereidingstraject waarvoor thans een startsubsidie wordt aangevraagd is erop gericht te komen tot een afbakening van het te verwerken materiaal, tot een formulering van eisen en een plan van aanpak ten aanzien van de te ontwikkelen digitale infrastructuur, en tot een omschrijving van de taakverdeling van de verschillende partners binnen het beoogde samenwerkingsverband. Memoria is een verzamelterm, die in de internationale mediëvistiek wordt gebruikt voor een breed scala aan fenomenen die betrekking hebben op gedenken. Het gaat daarbij om het gedenken van (overleden) personen, maar ook om de herinnering aan belangrijke gebeurtenissen zoals de stichting van instellingen. Memoria is daarom op te vatten als een veelzijdig fenomeen met een sterk identiteitsvormend karakter, dat religieuze, politieke, sociale, juridische en historiografische aspecten bevat. De bestudering van de memoria geeft een uniek inzicht in de manier waarop uiting werd gegeven aan de eigen identiteit en aan de perceptie van leven en dood en van verleden, heden en toekomst. Via tradities en kunstuitingen liet men zien hoe het was geweest, hoe het is en hoe men wilde dat het zou zijn. De neerslag van memoriauitingen is terug te vinden in een grote hoeveelheid bronnen, zowel geschreven teksten als objecten. Dit omvangrijke bronnenmateriaal is echter zeer moeilijk hanteerbaar voor onderzoekers, met name omdat het verspreid is over een groot aantal bewarende instellingen. Tot op heden bestaan er geen goede, overkoepelende overzichten van deze verschillende brontypen. Men beperkte zich daarom vooral tot casusonderzoek. Aan omvangrijk vergelijkend onderzoek van divers bronnenmateriaal is echter, ook internationaal, grote behoefte onder de onderzoekers die zich bezig houden met het interdisciplinaire onderzoeksterrein van de memoria. Beschikbaarstelling op het internet van beschijvingen van het bronnenmateriaal en van het bronnenmateriaal zelf maakt vergelijkend onderzoek mogelijk. MeMO streeft dan ook naar het toegankelijk maken van het - Nederlandse - materiaal van de vier voor het memoriaonderzoek centrale bronnentypen: 1. memorielijsten 2. verhalende bronnen 3. memorievoorstellingen en 4. grafzerken en grafmonumenten. Het gaat daarbij om een zo compleet mogelijke inventarisatie, om beschrijvingen van het materiaal en om afbeeldingen van de memorievoorstellingen en grafzerken / grafmonumenten. Voor het beschikbaarstellen van het volledige tekstmateriaal van de memorielijsten en de verhalende bronnen worden in samenwerking met erfgoedinstellingen de mogelijkheden onderzocht. De beoogde digitale infrastructuur zal in verschillende opzichten vernieuwend zijn. 1 Het te ontwikkelen systeem faciliteert omvangrijk comparatief onderzoek met behulp van verschillendsoortig bronnenmateriaal. Dit maakt het mogelijk nieuwe onderzoeksvragen te stellen en te beantwoorden, resultaten van casussen te toetsen op representativiteit en domeinkennis te verwerven. Zo kan een vergelijkend onderzoek van de verzamelhandschriften (met memorielijsten, kronieken, etc.) van kloosters meer inzicht geven in de overeenkomsten en verschillen in de praktijk van de dodengedachtenis binnen verschillende kloosterorden. 2. Het te verwerken materiaal is in hoofdzaak laatmiddeleeuws, terwijl het memoriaonderzoek zich in het buitenland traditioneel op de hoge middeleeuwen heeft gericht.

The first line of research is directed towards improving auto-matic speech recognition systems, guided by insights from human speech recognition. The second line of research applies insights from speech technology for the development of comprehensive computational models of human speech recognition. Finally, the third line applies the insights obtained from modelling automatic and human speech recognition to multimodal human-machine interaction, computer-assisted language learning and aug-mented communication. The main focus of this sub-programme is on developing novel models of automatic and human speech recognition. We are building improved models for automatic speech recognition by integrating knowledge about essential aspects of human speech processing. At the same time, we are applying successful techniques from the field of automatic speech recognition to develop comprehensive computational models of human speech recognition. We plan to continue and extend research in modelling pronunciation varia-tion and to further enhance our existing procedures for the creation of automatic phonetic transcriptions. We are also continuing our research in the field of robust automatic speech recognition, informed by the theory of active perception. A new line of research addresses the contribution that non-verbal, mainly prosodic, information in the speech signal can make to the recognition and interpretation of the verbal message. The long-term goal of this research is to create a novel architecture for speech recognition that can be used both as an operational recognition engine and as a realistic model of human speech recognition. Application directed research is concerned with multimodal human-machine inter-action, computer-assisted language learning and augmented communication. In multi-modal interaction the emphasis is on combining speech and pen input in services designed for use with small mobile terminals. In addition, we intend to investigate dialog models based on layered perception-action loops. Language learning applications address two different groups of users, users who are learning Dutch as their second language, and users with communicative disorders. For both user groups we are designing and testing computer-assisted systems for training and testing oral proficiency. The research aimed at relieving communication impairments is conducted in close collaboration with the Sint Maartenskliniek, in the framework of the Knowledge Centre for Language and Speech Technology in Rehabilitation. Although the research in this sub-programme is concerned primarily with Dutch as object language, we will also use English benchmark corpora when and where these are available to facilitate comparison with the results obtained in the international community.

This will allow us to extend the domain in which our expertise in language resources and language technology tools and techniques can be deployed in other fields of inquiry, such as literary and historicalstudies. During the last decade the issue of how applications of language and speech technology can be evaluated has become ever more urgent. We will respond to this development by developing suitable evaluation procedures for the applications mentioned in the previous paragraph, as well as for the evaluation of language technology components in more conventional applications such as question answering. During the next years we will intensify our already close working relations with the MPI, and especially the Technical Support Group for building an e-Humanities research infrastructure dedicated to the needs of linguistics and literary and cultural studies.

Such information is gathered through global advertisement expenditure measurement, which is performed by media monitoring companies. This type of business intelligence is a very complex task, which is currently performed manually and therefore is very expensive. A media campaign is defined as the universe of measures in order to fulfil a specific objective. MediaCampaign\'s scope is on discovering, inter-relating and navigating cross-media campaign knowledge and to automate a large degree of the detection and tracking of media campaigns on television, Internet and in the press. For the pilot system developed within the project the project focus is on a concrete example for a media campaign: advertisement campaigns. However, the approach taken and the component implementations will allow easy setup of a system for monitoring and analysis of other campaigns (e.g. political and social ones). In order to get the information as fast as possible the currently manual process to acquire the necessary data will be significantly accelerated by the MediaCampaign framework. Scientifically there are a number of high-risk research objectives to meet: (1) creation of a knowledge model for semantic description of media campaigns in general, (2) identification & tracking of new media campaigns in different media and (3) modelling of domain specific ontologies which relate media campaigns over different media and countries. In coherence with these scientific objectives R&D work carried out within MediaCampaign includes the design and implementation of a specific media campaign ontology (media presence & campaign ontology MEPCO), a module for cross relation of specific campaigns, algorithms for detecting advertisements over different media (utilizing different modalities), audio analysis algorithms and the detection plus tracking of new campaigns. In addition the R&D work will be concentrated on exploitation of semantic web technologies with a focus on querying and navigating within multi dimensional information spaces. In connection with cross relation a unique innovative approach will be followed by combining formal modelling of media campaigns with semantic content consolidation and reasoning and large-scale knowledge bases. With regard to audio analysis R&D work will be concentrated on segmentation, word spotting, dedicated speech to text modules and jingle recognition. In order to relate media campaigns over the different media TV, press and Internet we adopt the following innovative algorithm: use speech transcripts and OCR techniques to receive (noisy) text from A/V content, apply terminology identification and unsupervised clustering techniques for decision of most significant text parts, use those parts for a focussed web search and process the results of this search with IE methods in order to spot whether the campaign is new or not.', 0, 0, '2006-01-01', '2009-01-01', NULL, NULL, NULL),

He discovered that Dutch advanced learners of English are in many ways very close to native speakers. However, clear differences analysis also brought to light. Some more surprising than others. For example, sentences of learners, as expected, generally shorter and syntactically less complex than the sentences of native speakers. Less obvious example is that learners are far more likely than the native speakers clauses and compound words that express a causal relationship. Even if learners expand their meaning, for example, clauses, they appear to have a clear preference for the beginning of the sentence. Native speakers often interrupt their sentences by putting a clause in the middle or expand their meaning something to add to the end. The differences found Springer can be divided into four dimensions of discourse competence: brevity, confidence, complexity and degree of formality. Springer concludes on the basis of his continued research on existing teaching materials in existing textbooks for academic writing is really only focus on structural level of formality and not for the other dimensions. He recommends that developers of educational material for academic English writing these four dimensions as a guide to develop teaching materials.

Is the usage marked by ethnic and gender differences? Identity, Migration and Global Digital Media is a research project that seeks to understand the impact of new digital applications on the identity construction of young Dutch migrants in a transnational setting. This project is part of the Utrecht University High Potential program Wired up. Digital media as innovative socialization practices for migrant youth . Wired Up encompasses 3 PhD projects; two are placed within the social sciences, while mine is positioned within the humanities. Of chief importance is the investigation whether digital media create an alternative interactive space between the culture of origin and that of immigration, and how issues of identity, gender and ethnicity are negotiated between and within online and offline worlds. The research will nuance the Dutch debate on Islamophobia and multiculturalism by demonstrating how the new migrant generation uses digital media to either corroborate the dominant views of failed multiculturalism and ethnic segregation, or subscribe to a politics of hybridization in which multiple legacies, identities and loyalties are enacted. The theoretical framework will consider the interrelationships between (1.) globalization and new media, (2.) digital media and migration and (3.) youth culture and consumption. These three sets of relations have of course been researched earlier and in the writing on these relations, several extremes have been formulated. Very briefly, these extremes can be described as follows. Regarding the connection between globalization and new media, on the one hand it has been stated that ICT s can be seen as democratizing forces, empowering and accessible for all. This is the techno-utopian perspective. On the other hand, there is the techno-dystopian perspective, where the unbridgeable digital divide between the information haves and the information have-nots is underlined. Regarding the connection between digital media and migration, it has been stated on the one far end that new media stimulates the integration of migrants in their host societies. Youngsters for instance form networks of play on the basis of shared age in stead of ethnicity. Others have said that the usage of digital media leads migrants to turn increasingly inwards, as they re-establish strong connections with their culture of origin. Formulated differently, migrants are said to construct global ethnic identities as they link their local community with transnational networks. And finally when taking into account the relationship between youth culture and consumption, on the one hand, cultural industries target ethnic identities , while on the other hand youngsters alter the boundaries between producer and consumer by appropriating, resisting and manipulating digital media. Think of the vibrant, global youth culture of piracy. In my research project, I aim to find a middle-ground between these extreme positions through a combination of insights from media, postcolonial and gender studies. Additionally, I will address gender specific characteristics in media usage. Our goal is to combine frameworks and methodologies from both fields to achieve an interdisciplinary research outlook. These three PhD research projects share a combined methodology. Three forms of data collection make up a shared database, which all three researchers will use for their specific analysis. Data collection one consists of an online survey, the second data collection entails the monitoring of internet use, E-diaries and half-structured interviews, while the third covers an ethnographic study.

In parsing, a specific area of NLP, the ambiguity is characterized by multiple alternative syntactic analyses for a given input sentence. A parser has to cope with this difficulty, and has to choose among the various alternatives. Usually, the framework of probability theory and statistics is employed as modeling tool, leading to statistical parsing. Modern statistical parsers are trained on large annotated corpora (treebanks) and their parameters are estimated to reflect properties of the training data. Thus, a disambiguation component bases its decisions on the treebank and it will be successful as long as the treebank it was trained on is representative for the input the model gets. Hence, as might be expected, performance degrades when a model trained on one domain is applied to another domain. For example, a parser trained on newspaper text can be expected to have reasonable performance if it is applied to newspaper sentences. However, the model will be less adequate to analyze, say, spoken data. Hence, a well known problem arising from the domain dependence of a parsing systems is their portability. A simple solution to improve performance on a new domain is to construct a parser specifically for that domain. However, this amounts to hand-labeling a reasonable amount of training data which is clearly very expensive and leads to an unsatisfactory solution. In alternative, domain adaptation techniques try to leverage a small amount of already existing annotated data or to use unlabeled data from one domain to parse data from a different domain. The current project explores techniques for domain adaptation for Alpino, a wide-coverage analyzer for Dutch. In an initial experiment, a supervised approach to domain-adaptation has been examined, where a small amount of available in-domain data was assumed. In future research we will study techniques to gauge to what extent we can leverage either existing labeled data or also unlabeled data. This includes a more thorough research on the precise extent of the notion of domains.

This project adopts modern computational methods to answer this question from a broad phylogenetic perspective. Linguistic typology is currently struggling with the problem of making statistically valid statements about non-independent observations of typological variation. With only six or seven thousand languages in the world, many of them undocumented and all heavily skewed towards a few huge families, generalizations based on stratified samples will only ever be possible on a coarse scale. This project uses bioinformatic methods which model evolutionary processes to make statistically sensitive, probabilistic measurements of typological variation within a phylogenetic tree. This will take the study of typological variation to a new level: it will be possible for the first time to make statistical statements about typological stability, and to measure subtle typological interdependencies. Bioinformatic and geostatistical modelling of language variation allows the incorporation of more realistic assumptions about the processes of language change, and produces results with a number of statistically interesting and highly informative properties such as quantified uncertainty and relative chronology. This project bridges the divide between historical linguistics and the evolutionary sciences. While the idea of treating language change as an evolutionary system is not new, modern phylogenetic methods allow a wider range of different aspects of language to be modelled. The effects of the revolution in bioinformatics are beginning to be felt in the humanities, and it is important that linguists take an active role in setting the scientific agenda, so that the accumulated insights of the discipline are not lost.

Additionally, he introduced a novel method enabling the simultaneous identification of dialect areas together with their characteristic linguistic features (in terms of sound correspondences). For both English and Dutch, he found sensible dialect areas as well as their characteristic features. For example, for the Frisian area, we identify the addition of sj as highly characteristic: wachten to wait becomes wachtsje. inally, he has developed an integrated approach which is able to determine the influence of various factors on dialect variation per word. Not only is this method able to include the effect of geographical proximity, but it also allows a focus on various social and word-related factors (such as speaker age, or the frequency of a word). For example, Dutch dialect words differ most from their standard Dutch counterpart in the provinces of Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel, Limburg and Zeeland. In addition, he finds that the dialect pronunciations of a community with a small number of inhabitants or a high average age differ more from the standard Dutch language than those of a community having a large number of inhabitants or a low average age. Finally, he finds that more frequent words are more resistant to standardization (in different languages). This dissertation focuses on real dialect pronunciations.

This data comes in many forms: from various kinds of maps such as roadmaps, height maps, maps about vegetation, or from data from remote sensing, stored in Geographic Information Systems.

Virtual world designers can possibly be relieved of some of these laborious modeling methods, but automatic creation of such worlds is still a largely unsolved problem. \n      To create adaptive game-play, dynamic world models are required that can automatically be adapted to changing requirements.

There was a dramatic increase in the amount of information, giving rise to new knowledge, theories and world images. The Dutch Republic played a key role in this \'information society\' avant la lettre. Its global trade network, its prosperity and its relative tolerance made the Republic a refuge for intellectuals from around Europe. But how did the 17th-century scientific information system actually work? How were new elements of knowledge picked up, processed, disseminated and - ultimately - accepted in broad circles of the educated community? In short: how did knowledge circulate? The 17th-century Republic offers an ideal case for exploring the answers to this question, and correspondence between scholars is the ideal research subject. That is because until the publication of the first scientific journals in the 1660s, letters were by far the most direct and important means of communication between intellectuals. In order to answer the research question, it will be necessary to analyze a huge amount of such correspondence systematically. Traditional research methods are inadequate, and for that reason a consortium of universities, research institutes and cultural heritage institutions aims to build a multidisciplinary collaboratory to analyze a machine-readable and growing corpus starting with, but not limited to, the approximately 20,000 letters of scholars who lived in the 17th-century Dutch Republic. The grant of 495,000 euro being requested from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) will not be used to fund the digitization of the letters - the consortium will bear the costs of that itself - but to build the web-based tools to analyze and visualize the 17th-century intellectual networks and their themes of interest, and to enrich this corpus with annotations.

How can one connect philology of ancient texts and computational linguistic analysis? One can observe in the world of ICT research an increasing interest in the Humanities, going beyond computational linguistics or the digitization of literary texts. However, researchers in the area of literary interpretation of biblical or other ancient texts hesitate. They welcome easy access to digitized texts and images of manuscripts on the Internet, but they doubt how traditional methods of literary interpretation and ICT methods of linguistic analysis of text corpora could be combined. Of course, for grammatical or lexical riddles in a particular text, a database of the full corpus and an efficient search engine is very helpful. However, for the main tasks of philology one seems to have to continue the traditional way, i.e. argue about the compositional unity of individual ancient texts, about rhetoric techniques, search for the identity of the actors in a particular text and for the historical background of its writers and originally intended readers. Thus the gap is a real one and not just a product of conservative scholarship in Humanities. How then does one proceed? Research in recent years has produced databases of linguistically analyzed Hebrew and Aramaic texts, for the retrieval of grammatical and lexical data. We think that they now ought to be enriched further to develop more tools and try to construct a bridge. To do so it is crucial to start at either side of the gap to be bridged. Therefore, we have designed three Project Constituents. PC1 will develop linguistic methodology to be used in philology: tools and data to construct grammatical knowledge for a critical assessment of the results of current traditions of literary interpretation and translation. PC2 starts at the other side. It will develop methods that fit the complex structure of literary artefacts from cultural and religious history: instruments for the construction and storage of data of literary analysis and interpretation, both the data that can be derived from linguistic analysis of complex phenomena, and the data that in fact are proposals of scholarly reading, that is, annotations.

Motifs are complex higher-level patterns that recur in a non-accidental way; they contribute crucially to the function of the story (Propp, 1928), and have evolved over time, gaining cultural significance along a long path of oral and written transmission and canonization.\n\nCultural heritage objects can often be characterized by the motifs they contain, and a considerable amount of research on these objects takes into account this important aspect.

Besides characterizing it as a trance-like state, Nell did leave absorption largely untheorized. Researchers within various disciplines from both the Humanities and the Social Sciences have stepped in and tried to describe absorption. Their separate endeavors have resulted in a terminology that is bewilderingly diverse. As a phenomenon absorption knows both proponents and opponents in the practical field of narrative creation and reception. Writers of political messages and advertisements have made good use of its persuasive effects. Societal concerns are raised about harmful impact of narratives created to confuse its audience as to what is real, lure them into adopting certain attitudes, or take particular ideological positions for granted (Appel 2008). In addition, concerns are expressed regarding a lack of the kinds of narratives that can make readers more critical and self-aware. Ronald Plasterk, the Dutch Minister of Culture, recently signalled the tendency of commercial media to offer only absorbing entertainment, and warned that media have the duty to dislodge audiences out of their comfort zone in order to open their mind to attend critically to what happens in the world. So far, however, claims about societal effects of narrative absorption, whether positive or negative, cannot be scientifically evaluated. In part this is due to the absence of empirical research on the mechanisms that underlie absorption (Bilandzic and Kinnebrock 2009). Although some progress has been made in measuring ?absorption-like states? and in identifying textual factors relevant in this context (Green 2004), little is known about what varieties of absorption there are, what features of narrative play a role in its production, how these features may interact with recipient traits, and how absorption relates to responses perhaps less comfortable than superficial fun, such as aesthetic and moral reflections. The research project proposed here will present a taxonomy of absorption-like experiential states. It will identify narrative features responsible for these states in 2 different media, film and literature. It will explore personality traits of viewers and readers that are relevant in bringing about absorption. And it will clarify relationships between narrative absorption and aesthetic experiences and their after effects. Accordingly our leading research question is: What is the role of absorption in aesthetic and other responses to literary and cinematic narratives? To answer this question, the current project innovatively unites empirical research with methodologies that are typical in the Humanities (i.e., text-analytic approaches to narrative; theoretical concerns about aesthetic responses; comparative media studies). Through collaboration with creative partners (e.g., authors, film directors), we intend to shape our materials in order to precisely match our research goals. The design of the project allows for a media-comparative approach with one PhD-project focusing on absorption in literature, and another on absorption in film. Furthermore, the entire research team is involved in a final experiment that targets a comparison between both media in their relations to absorption and to aesthetic experiences. Both PhD-projects consist of 4 experimental studies in which medium-specific narrative features that result in absorption related experiential states are identified. They will involve careful text-manipulation and take into account the contribution of reader/viewer characteristics (e.g., in terms of media literacy). To ultimately determine different experiential profiles, the Post-Doc project will conduct quantitative and qualitative empirical research to come to nuanced explicative characterizations of relationships between absorption profiles and aesthetic experiences, using the results of the two PhD- projects. The synthesis by the two applicants, relates the underlying mechanisms of narrative absorption to claims regarding positive or negative societal effects. Lastly, in the Post-Doc-articles as well as in the monograph, findings of all studies are considered in relation to games and virtual reality. The scholarly relevance of our research lies predominantly in providing the Humanities with an empirically founded understanding of narrative impact and the factors that influence it. Our studies are aimed at clarifying the relation between text factors, absorption, and aesthetic experience. These are all central concerns of scholars of literature, film, theatre, game studies (cf. Hakemulder 2008c). The project also offers essential contributions to the accumulating insights of social scientists concerning the role of absorption in narrative effects. Questions that require an answer prior to such (important) work are: what makes a narrative absorbing in the first place? How are particular forms of being absorbed related to feeling entertained, or enraptured, or inspired by its beauty? And finally, how do the answers to these questions inform the study of narrative effects? It seems plausible that these answers are fundamental to our understanding of narrative impact (e.g., on mood, escape, happiness, social interaction skills, critical thinking, openness to form and ideas, attitude and belief changes (Hakemulder 2000, Oatley 1999, 2002). We envision two major practical applications of our results. One is to solidify the knowledge base of media literacy training, which in this increasingly mediated culture is now more important than ever. The other is that creative storytellers (e.g., involved in storytelling in marketing and management) are provided with directives regarding ways in which textual features relate to particular types of (aesthetic) responses, including finding stories captivating. All of these are themes of interest to other absorbing media as well, most importantly perhaps games and other virtual reality media, as their user population is expanding so rapidly and pervasively. On a more general cultural note, a better understanding of the nature and origin of absorption and other related phenomena is crucial for deploying aesthetic antidotes to superficial entertainment.', 0, 0, '2010-09-01', '2014-08-01', 'NWO', NULL, NULL),

This tradition of literary interpretation doesn\'t leave much room for a systematic linguistic analysis of Biblical Hebrew, and of Biblical Hebrew poetry in particular. Thus, poetic texts are considered to be artistic and beautiful, but individual pieces of art. This gap between Linguistics and poetry in the discipline of Old Testament studies is also visible in the literary approach\'s claim that in poetry the use of verbal forms isn\'t bound to any grammatical rules, but expresses the Biblical poet\'s rhetorical skills. This claim is the main source of the research problem that will be dealt with in this dissertation: the ignorance of scholars regarding the functions of verbal forms in Biblical Hebrew poetry. \nAs a solution to this problem we will propose a methodological shift from literary interpretation to linguistic analysis. Since the second half of the twentieth century Old Testament scholars have started to pay attention to the interaction between Theology and Linguistics which eventually resulted in the formation of a new approach called Text-Linguistics. Advocators of this approach stimulate the use of linguistic instruments in the analysis of Biblical Hebrew texts and assume this analysis should start with an investigation of the syntactic structures and relations that can be found within these texts. Because verbal forms fulfill important functions in the syntactic ordering of the texts, many text-linguistic publications concentrate on the analysis of the linguistic functions that can be assigned to these different verbal forms. Unfortunately, text-linguists until now have mainly been analyzing prosaic texts, while poetic texts and their use of verbal forms have hardly received any attention.\nTherefore, based on these two shifts - the first one being methodological, the second being related to text-linguistics\' object of study - a new methodological framework will be presented. Within this framework we will introduce the hypothesis that there is one single linguistic system which underlies the use of verbal forms in both Biblical Hebrew poetry and Biblical Hebrew prose. Taking the observation of many analogies between discursive prose\'s verbal system and poetry\'s use of verbal forms as a starting point in our research project, our hypothesis will be tested by critically analyzing text-linguistic publications about the functions of verbal forms in discursive prose and poetry and by performing our own linguistic analysis of the functioning of verbal forms in discursive prose and poetry. At the end of our research, we will investigate how our research may help the Bible translator and the Old Testament exegete - both often feeling very uncomfortable whith the practical situation of a free interpretation of verbal forms dependent on insight in context and on ones own intuition - to establish a more consistent interpretation of verbal froms in classical Hebrew poetry.', 1, 0, '2011-09-01', '2015-08-01', NULL, NULL, NULL),

Mobile devices, geographical information systems (GIS), geographical positioning systems (GPS) and radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies have made ‘always online everywhere’ today’s maxim. Today, most household appliances or vehicles have more computing power than the early PC’s from twenty-five years ago and so-called ‘smart buildings’ and ‘responsive environments’ are being designed and engineered that respond to and even anticipate the requirements, needs, and desires of their users (so-called ubiquitous and pervasive computing).. Computing devices become sensitive to the location, movements and actions of their owners and people with whom they are connected through digital networks. These developments not only blur the boundaries between ‘virtual’ and ‘material’ reality (as commonsensically conceived), but new mobile and wireless devices and new forms of ubiquitous, ambient and pervasive computing, also organize human-computer interaction by taking into account the whereabouts, purposes, habits, moods etc. of the users, thus putting the bodily presence and affective states of the latter center stage. Haptic and tactile interfaces (e.g. touch screens), sensors, actuators, tags, wearable computing, voice- and face recognition technologies and more will transform human-computer interaction from a mainly optical and cognitive operation into a bodily and affective experience.\nThe Interface Studies project aims at studying the ways in which interfaces organize, enhance or constrain the interactions between human users and computer based systems and how they shape subjectivity, agency, and affective and bodily experience. On the one hand the project will look into the historical antecedents of the current development to ubiquitous, ambient, and pervasive computing such as the works of pioneers like Myron Krueger and Roy Ascott and the theoretical (and practical) explorations of the interface by Brenda Laurel, Jaron Lanier and others. On the other hand, will look into new and upcoming developments such as the emergence of haptic and tactile interfaces, wearable computing, smart houses, and responsive environments and examine their aesthetic, kinesthetic, rhetorical, expressive, and semiotic potential.\nThe penetration of digital technology into virtually every aspect of everyday life has made the study of the experiential dimensions of interfaces not only an urgent matter for the humanities, but increasingly also for engineers, designers, and programmers, who are, like architects already for centuries, confronted with the social, cultural, and experiential impact of their products. The Interface Studies project aims at an interdisciplinary approach in which academics from the humanities and scientists and engineers collaborate.

Modeling Oral Transmission', 'Oral transmission is a fascinating aspect of the broader phenomenon of cultural transmission. In oral culture, artefacts such as songs and stories are passed on to next generations without written or technical reproduction media, just by voice and ear. Oral transmission implies alteration and variation to a considerable extent. Yet after several generations of oral transmission the artefacts are still ‘the same’ (in oral terms), or at least recognizable variants (from a literate point of view). How can this be? Are there convergent forces? How can we model the process of oral transmission?\n\nIn the project Tunes & Tales we will create such models, based on the vast oral corpora of Dutch folksongs and Dutch and Frisian folktales of the Meertens Institute. We will consider two categories: tunes (music) and tales (text). Firstly, we will formalize tunes and tales as layered sequences of motifs, this will result in prototype systems for the automatic recognition of motifs in tunes and tales. Formalization is an important first step that will enable the analysis of large amounts of available data for creating models of the mechanism of oral transmission. On top of that, automatic recognition of motifs can be used for automatic classification of the corpora – a much needed practical application for making the Meertens collections further accessible for ethnomusicological and ethnological research.\n\nBased on the automated analysis of motif sequences, a generative model that simulates the oral transmission including the inherent variation will be created. The models will be tested on the oral material of the Meertens Institute in cooperation with domain experts. This will contribute to understanding the mechanism of oral transmission as described above.\n\nA software engineer will robustly implement successful models developed during the project. The resulting tools will be integrated in the Dutch Song and Folktale Databases of the Meertens Institute and made available to other researchers. Thus the project will have both a theoretical and a practical impact on the research of oral culture.

"Mapping the Via Appia" aims at a thorough inventory and analysis of the Roman interventions in their suburban landscape, focussing on a section of the road. The wealth of archaeological monuments preserved both above and beneath ground level, as well as the opulent documentary evidence in archives and digital resources (mainly photographs), make a very detailed multidisciplinary analysis of the history of the road and its surroundings possible. At the same time, this huge amount of wide-ranging data poses some methodological challenges and requires the development of new documentation and analysis strategies. The complex architectural design of several monuments, as well as the detailed archival records, have resulted in an archaeological and historical landscape which cannot be studied by only using established recording systems like regional field survey projects. Therefore, the project uses a new and innovative research strategy designed especially for the efficient recording and study of complex and monumental archaeological landscapes with long occupational histories. For this means, professional GPS (DGPS) is used which refines the techniques of archaeological survey and documentation of visual remains. The proposed project\'s main strength, however, is the use of new 3D spatial mapping and analysis techniques, combined with geophysical prospection, remote sensing techniques, field survey, excavation and archival studies. As a result, the project not only offers invaluable new data on the functioning of this particular and other Roman consular roads, but will also provide a new methodological framework for studying monumental archaeological landscapes that can be used and further devolved on other research projects.

The new database - \'Database Dutch Songs On Line\' (DDSOL) - will stimulate research into Dutch song culture which draws on the increased opportunities provided by advances in technology which have significantly altered and especially broadened the scope of research in the humanities. The DDSOL will combine the work done by the Nederlandse Liederenbank (NLB, Dutch Song Database) and the Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren (DBNL, Digital Library for Dutch Literature). The current internet version of the NLB - the most recent result of an NWO-project started in 1986 at the Utrecht University and continued by the Meertens Instituut with other organizations - has already put scholarship in the Netherlands at the international forefront of developments in the digitization of song culture. The NLB is unique not only for its size (one of the largest world wide) but especially for the richness of searchable metadata it provides on the songs it contains. However, it has one key deficiency: it contains very few transcriptions of the songs themselves. Individual songs (texts and melodies) are ultimately the key for studying song culture as a whole. The proposed project intends to address this need by coordinating two existing data sets, those of the DBNL and the NLB, and significantly expanding them into a comprehensive new database by adding a new, large data set with full transcriptions, links to scans and contextual information. The search possibilities of DDSOL will enable researchers to reconstruct networks of melodies and lyrics within the corpus. The applicants, together with a group of affiliated scholars, over the course of the project will produce two thematic volumes containing studies on religious and profane song culture. These studies will shed new light on the relationship between song and the formation and shaping of groups and group identities in Dutch society from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. Their central hypothesis will be that songs are an important factor in constructing social identity, and that such social identity (tied to confession, class, age, profession and gender), as well as shifts in it through time, can be traced through the ways in which the songs are intertwined, in patterns of production and reception, and in performance.

It introduces the concept of reference culture as a crucial addition to the humanities toolbox to discuss long-term asymmetrical processes of cultural exchange involving dimensions of power and hegemony. The concept recognizes the fact that some cultures assume a dominant role in the international circulation of knowledge and practices, offering or imposing a model that others imitate, adapt, or resist. More specifically, the project will add to our understanding of the global position of the Netherlands as a knowledge-based economy thriving on the innovation that emerges from international cultural encounters. Reference cultures are mental constructs that do not necessarily represent a geopolitical reality with an internal hierarchy and recognizable borders. These culturally conditioned images of trans-national models are typically established and negotiated in public discourses over a long period of time. However, the specific historical dynamics of reference cultures have never been systematically analyzed and hence are not fully understood. To explore these dynamics, this project asks three interrelated questions. (1) How were ideas, products and practices associated with the United States valued in Dutch public discourse between 1890 and 1990? (2) How can e-tools be used to map trends and changes in relation to the economic power, cultural acceptance, and scientific and technological impact of the United States as reference culture? (3) How does public discourse reflect and influence the emergence and impact of reference cultures? We propose that the key to understanding the emergence and dominance of reference cultures is to chart the public discourse in which these collective frames of reference are established. The availability of a large digital data collection in the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) enables us for the first time to study long-term developments and transformations in these national discourses in a systematic, longitudinal, and quantifiable way by using innovative text-mining tools.

CAMeRA\'s research program e-Learning and Entertainment aims at an in-depth understanding of the entertainment functions, uses and effects in learning and development, both from a fundamental and applied perspective. Research pursued in this program is interdisciplinary in scope covering the schools of social sciences, computer sciences, humanities, and psychology. Oftentimes, we also develop materials, tools, and measurement devices in collaborative efforts to meet our goals (e.g., games for diagnosis, training, health coaches, or experimental variations). Research initiatives within CAMeRA cross-bridge a variety of insights, theories, and methodologies from various disciplines to enrich and strengthen each other\'s research efforts and develop innovative, cutting-edge research in studying the opportunities and challenges that today\'s new media offer for communication in its broadest sense. Entertainment has a profound impact on and shapes social behaviour of particularly the young; however, entertainment media applications increasingly intrude in the lives of the elderly (e.g., the project Ambient Assisted Living). An important question studied within the research program e-Learning and Entertainment is how entertainment media may serve or hinder individual well-being and well-being in society at large. In general, a better understanding of how entertainment may support or hinder learning processes en what underlying cognitive and affective processes serve such functions, will be helpful in applying appropriate entertainment tools in various applications in the entertainment industry, but also in health, business, commerce, learning, and training environments. Virtual environments as an interface for learning and enjoyment, but also the development of robots with human-like cognitive and empathetic abilities is one of the lines of research within this field with respect to media-interaction. Another line focuses on the effects of the continued growth and widespread use of various media, for example, on language development, aggression, morality, health, relationships, and emotion regulation. CAMeRA\'s use of entertainment media for research and application are often integrated into the virtual technology that we develop in-house (e.g., see \'Games as research and training tools\' below), accessible to all researchers engaged in CAMeRA. The e-Learning and Entertainment program closely collaborates with the e-Health and Care program in terms of the applications but also with e-Language for societal impact and to a lesser extent with e-Heritage on media-semantics.', 0, 0, '2012-01-01', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The subsequent merger between design and validation research provides a crucial testing ground to assess and validate the value of the knowledge we aim to produce. The process of persuasion is approached from a humanities perspective focusing on the interplay of different persuasive dimensions, including storytelling and playful interaction. The cases extend beyond traditional videogames incorporating also transmedia storytelling platforms and ambient games creating play experiences closely integrated in the context of e.g. city life, therapy or education.

Access to the musical heritage has its own set of problems that have not been addressed as yet in the CATCH core projects.\nMusic’s most important manifestation, sound generated during performance, is volatile. It can be captured, though imperfectly, in two ways, as sound recording and as music notation. Worldwide, huge amounts of music have been recorded and notated in attempts to document and preserve traditional culture.\nIn the Netherlands, Ate Doornbosch created a collection of national importance for his famous radio programme Onder de Groene Linde (‘Under the Green Limetree’).

The CLIO-DAP project wants to explore whether leading journals are interested in adopting a DAP, if they need support for this, and how such support could be organised.\nIt explores which new workflows are needed and which existing ones can be adapted, and will demonstrate how such workflow requirements can function in practice using proven standards.\nA demonstrator-service for enhanced publications will be built to showcase existing output from DAP-journals, illustrate the workflows and help convince stakeholders in other journals to adopt similar policies.\nThis will be done in cooperation with the IEHA (International Economic History Association).

Learning from (social-economic) history helps to understand the interrelation between macro-economic change and individual lifestyles, policy regimes, labour markets, communities and national wealth. However, sources of historical information about the lives of individuals, communities, and nations are still scattered.\\nThis project takes Dutch census data as a starting point to build a semantic data-web of historical information. With such a web we will answer questions such as:\\n- What kind of patterns can we identify and interpret in expressions of regional identity?\\n- How to relate patterns of changes in skills and labour to technological progress and patterns of geographical migration?\\n- How to trace changes of local and national policies in the structure of communities and individual lives?\\nCensus data alone are not sufficient to answer these questions. This project applies a specific web-based data-model – exploiting the Resource Description Framework (RDF) technology– to make census data inter-linkable with other hubs of historical socio-economic and demographic data and beyond. Pattern recognition appears on two levels: first to enable the integration of hitherto isolated datasets, and second to apply integrated querying and analysis across this new, enriched information space. Data analysis interfaces, visual inventories of historical data and reports on open-linked data strategies for digital collections are results of this project. The project will result in generic methods and tools to weave historical and socio-economic datasets into an interlinked semantic data-web.",\r\n        "end_date": "2016-04-01",\r\n

At a European and to some extent also global level, the project shows the ways in which local and national welfare regimes emerged in this period and demonstrates that such arrangements were deeply embedded in transnational contacts. The overall aim of the research, underlying the collaborative activities proposed in this application, is to highlight the interconnectedness of local activism, national reform agendas and the transnational circulation of ideas and practices related to welfare, and social and cultural reform. The project deliverables are (1) the establishment of a structured, coherent and sustainable network of researchers from six countries focused on the study of social reform in a transnational perspective; (2) the elaboration of a VRE, including website and joint database; (3) the extension of the current experimental database of people, organizations, congresses and publications dealing with social reform issues; (4) three workshops; (5) the preparation of a European funding proposal; (6) publications in peer reviewed journals with an international scope.",\r\n        "funding_body":

Physical-geographical and biogeological data point at marked climatic variability and changing landscapes during this time interval. \\n\\nIn geomorphologically sensitive regions such as river deltas and coastal areas these changes must have had a noticeable impact on the location and lay-out of urban centres and rural settlements, land use and subsistence strategies, and connections of population centres to their economical ‘hinterland’. Recent developments in digital infrastructure in the Humanities and Geosciences in the Netherlands for the first time enable us to study these phenomena from an interregional and interdisciplinary perspective. \\n \\nIn this programme we study how settlement dynamics, land use, infrastructure, demography and trade between AD 300 and 1000 were related to changes of the landscape and climate, focusing on the Lowlands’ geomorphologically most sensitive regions. This reconstruction takes place within three complementary PhD-projects, in the realms of archaeology, physical geography and biogeology, using the following data sources. The programme intends to contribute to the archaeological understanding of dynamics in the Early Medieval Lowlands and to enhance the framework for future research of this key period.\\n \\nProject A focuses on occupation patterns and land use in coastal, river and Pleistocene sandy regions, project B on natural geomorphologic landscape dynamics in these regions, and project C on vegetation changes and climate. We use dendrochronology-based information about the exact age of settlements and infrastructure, economy, landscape evolution, vegetation and climate to connect the projects. \\n \\nThe programme results will be synthesized in an interdisciplinary reconstruction of the interactions between cultural and environmental dynamics in the Lowlands between AD 300 and 1000 in a broader northwest-European context.  \\n\\n\\nFor more information and latest news on the project also see: http://www.darkagesproject.com​.",\r\n        "end_date": "2019-06-30",\r\n        "funding_body": "NWO section Humanities",\r\n        "funding_size": "780.000",\r\n        "currency_id": "1",\r\n        "is_phd": "1",\r\n        "phd_students": "3",\r\n        "subproject_ids": "1.

De marges van vroegmiddeleeuwse manuscripten bevatten aantekeningen die laten zien dat teksten niet alleen maar gekopieerd werden in deze wereld van handgeschreven boeken, maar dat ze actief werden bestudeerd en gebruikt. Lange tijd zijn de marginale aantekeningen beschouwd als onbeduidende schrijfsels van anonieme monniken. Dit project betoogt dat ze juist veelzeggende bronnen vormen van intellectuele geschiedenis: zij vertellen het verhaal van de veranderingen in kennis op velerlei gebied, van de natuurlijke fenomenen van de kosmos tot de orthodoxe leer over predestinatie. Zij geven inzicht in de methoden en interesses van wetenschap en onderzoek in deze periode. De praktijken van het annoteren van handschriften zijn tot op heden nauwelijks in kaart gebracht. Dit project zet ze in de schijnwerpers, omdat ze een onverwacht rijk en nieuw licht werpen op het intellectuele leven in Europa in de vroege Middeleeuwen.",\r\n        "start_date": "2011-05-01",\r\n        "end_date": "2016-30-04",\r\n        "funding_size": "700000",\r\n        "funding_body": "NWO",\r\n        "currency_id": "1",\r\n        "phd_students": "1"\r\n    },\r\n    "NwoDiscipline": {\r\n        "ProjectsNwoDiscipline": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "1"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "TadirahActivity": {\r\n        "ProjectsTadirahActivity": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "4"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "5"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "TadirahTechnique": {\r\n        "ProjectsTadirahTechnique": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_technique_id": "15"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "159"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_technique_id": "19"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_technique_id": "27"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "TadirahObject": {\r\n        "ProjectsTadirahObject": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_object_id": "15"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "255",\r\n                "tadirah_object_id": "31"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "ProjectLink": {\r\n        "0": {\r\n            "id": "",\r\n            "project_id": "255",\r\n            "project_link_type_id": "2",\r\n            "url": "http://marginalia.huygens.knaw.nl/view/codices/"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}', 'mariken.teeuwen@huygens.knaw.nl', '', 'The Project Leader is also the Principal Investigator - the main researcher in the project', '', '2016-01-22 14:53:46', '2016-01-22 14:53:46'),

Onderzoekers kunnen bij DARIAH terecht voor het vinden van data en tools, het archiveren van hun data, kennisuitwisseling en advies op het gebied van metadata en digitalisering. Het European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) heeft het belang van de ontwikkeling van DARIAH onderstreept door het project op te nemen in zijn Roadmap 2006. Daarin zijn nog vier belangrijke initiatieven in de alfa- en gammawetenschappen opgenomen, waaronder een vergelijkbaar voorstel voor een data-infrastructuur voor de gammawetenschappen (CESSDA Major Upgrade) en voor taalkundige hulpbronnen (CLARIN). In het najaar van 2008 is gestart met het project Preparing DARIAH , waarin alle voorbereidingen voor de constructie worden getroffen. Voorbereidend werk betreft onder meer juridisch werk en het ontwikkelen en testen van een prototype. Het 2 jaar durende project wordt medegefinancierd door de Europese Commissie. In totaal zijn er 14 organisaties uit 10 landen als partner betrokken bij het project. Daarnaast hebben zich al verschillende organisaties uit andere landen aangemeld als geïnteresseerde. De DARIAH website geeft meer details over de activiteiten en de partners. Het Preparing DARIAH project is eind februari 2011 afgesloten. De periode 2011-2013 kan gekenschetst worden als een transitie-fase. DARIAH is in 2014 een ERIC geworden en zit nu in de opbouwfase.

This Action will tackle this urgent problem using the unique networking and capacity-building features provided by the COST framework. For the first time, a platform will be created where information professionals, sociologists, physicists, digital humanities scholars and computer scientists collaborate on problems of data mining and data curation in collections. The main objective of this Action is advancing the analysis of large knowledge spaces and systems that organize and order them. The combination of insights from complexity theory and knowledge organization will improve our understanding of the collective, self-organized nature of human knowledge production and will support the development of new principles and methods of data representation, processing, and archiving. To this end, the knowledge organization in web-based information spaces such as Wikipedia as well as collections from libraries, archives, and museums will be studied. This Action aims to create interactive knowledge maps. Their end users could be scientists working between disciplines and seeking mutual understanding; science policy makers designing funding frameworks; cultural heritage institutions aiming at better access to their collections; and students seeking a first orientation in academia.",\r\n        "start_date": "2013-04-26",\r\n        "end_date": "2017-04-25",\r\n        "funding_body": "COST Association",\r\n        "currency_id": "1",\r\n        "phd_students": "20"\r\n    },\r\n    "NwoDiscipline": {\r\n        "ProjectsNwoDiscipline": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "14"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "11"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "6"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "4"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "TadirahActivity": {\r\n        "ProjectsTadirahActivity": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "31"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "37"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "39"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "41"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "40"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "42"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "5"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "7"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "48"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "49"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "50"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "53"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "55"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "301",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "58"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "ProjectLink": {\r\n        "0": {\r\n            "id": "",\r\n            "project_id": "301",\r\n            "project_link_type_id": "3",\r\n            "url": "http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/mpns/TD1210"\r\n        },\r\n        "1": {\r\n            "id": "",\r\n            "project_id": "301",\r\n            "project_link_type_id": "3",\r\n            "url": "www.knowescape.org"\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    "ProjectExternalIdentifier": {\r\n        "1": {\r\n            "id": "",\r\n            "project_id": "301"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}', 'andrea.scharnhorst@dans.knaw.nl', '', 'I\'m not the project leader (this is a NARCIS category) but the Chair.

In the next phase, this project involves development of a central database that allows for aggregation of content across the individual book Web sites, such that object relationships, discursive threads, and contextual factors can be made explicit.",\r\n        "parent_not_listed": "SurfShare Enhanced Publications"\r\n    },\r\n    "NwoDiscipline": {\r\n        "ProjectsNwoDiscipline": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "14"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "17"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "nwo_discipline_id": "6"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "TadirahActivity": {\r\n        "ProjectsTadirahActivity": [\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "2"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "23"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "25"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "22"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "5"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "7"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "48"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "51"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                "id": "",\r\n                "project_id": "271",\r\n                "tadirah_activity_id": "52"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}', 'andrea.scharnhorst@dans.knaw.nl', '', '', '', '2016-03-28 13:41:08', '2016-03-28 13:41:08'),

	(1, 59, 'Capture', 'Capture generally refers to the activity of creating digital surrogates of existing cultural artefacts, or expressing existing artifacts in a digital representation (digitization). This could be a manual process (as in "transcribing") or an automated procedure (as in "imaging" or "data_recognition"). Such capture precedes "enrichment" and "analysis", at least from a systematic point of view, if not in practice. '),
	(2, 59, 'Creation', 'Creating things generally refers to the activity of producing born-digital digital objects, rather than creating digital objects by capturing and digitizing existing analog objects. Creating can involve writing natural language text (cf. "writing") or, understood more broadly as the creation of a string of discrete symbols, it could also concern other forms of expression, such as creating executable code (cf. "programming"), composing a musical score, or creating an image.'),
	(3, 59, 'Enrichment', 'Enrichment refers to the activity of adding information to an object of enquiry, by making its origin, nature, structure, meaning, or elements explicit. This activity typically follows the capture of the object. '),
	(4, 59, 'Analysis', 'This general research goal refers to the activity of extracting any kind of information from open or closed, structured or unstructured collections of data, of discovering recurring phenomena, units, elements, patterns, groupings, and the like. This can refer to structural, formal or semantic aspects of data. Analysis also includes methods used to visualize results. Methods and techniques related to this goal may be considered to follow "capture" and "enrichment"; however, "enrichment" depends upon assumptions, research questions and results related to "analysis". '),
	(5, 59, 'Interpretation', 'Interpretation is the activity of ascribing meaning to phenomena observed in "analysis". Therefore, interpretation usually follows analysis, although it could also be considered that interpretation defines the hermeneutic perspective of any method of analysis. '),
	(6, 59, 'Storage', 'Storing refers to the activity of making digital copies of objects of inquiry, results of research, or software and services and of keeping them accessible, without necessarily making them available to the public. '),
	(7, 59, 'Dissemination', 'Dissemination refers to the activity of making objects of inquiry, results of research, or software and services available to fellow researchers or the wider public in a variety of more or less formal ways. It builds on or requires storing and can include releasing and sharing of data using a variety of methods and techniques including the application of linked open data.'),
	(9, 1, 'conversion', 'Conversion refers to changing the file format of an object (e.g. converting a .wmv video to a .mov file as well as converting VHS into a digital format) without fundamentally changing the content or nature of the object. When conversion concerns metadata, it involves mapping one metadata schema to another. More fundamental “conversions”, such as converting a scanned page image to an editable text document, are better referred to using “DataRecognition”.'),
	(10, 1, 'DataRecognition', 'Data Recognition, for example OCR, refers to the process of treating the immediate products of digital data capture (recording or imaging), such as digital facsimiles of texts or of sheet music, in a way to extract discrete, machine-readable units from them, such as plain text words, musical notes, or still or moving image elements (including, for example, face recognition).'),
	(11, 1, 'Discovering', 'Discovering is the activity of seeking out objects of research, research results, or other information which is useful in a given search perspective. Discovery includes very directed techniques such as advanced querying of databases, less directed techniques such as simple searching, and more serendipitous ones as browsing, which would include faceted browsing. (It is different from Information Retrieval, which is a structured way of extracting some piece of information or some specific subset of objects from a resource.)'),
	(12, 1, 'Gathering', 'Gathering refers to aggregating discovered resources, usually in some structured way (e.g. bringing together all papers that address a certain topic, as part of a literature review, or pulling all works by a particular author out of a digital collection for further analysis). Related techniques include web crawling and scraping.'),
	(13, 1, 'Imaging', 'Imaging refers to the capture of texts, images, artefacts or spatial formations using optical means of capture. Imaging can be made in 2D or 3D, using various means (light, laser, infrared, ultrasound). Imaging usually does not lead to the identification of discrete semantic or structural units in the data, such as words or musical notes, which is something DataRecognition accomplishes. Imaging also includes scanning and digital photography.'),
	(14, 1, 'Recording', 'Capturing audio and/or video; the result is a digital audio (e.g. WAV, MP3, etc.) or video (e.g. MP4, Quicktime, etc.) file that can be manipulated, analyzed, and/or stored.'),
	(21, 1, 'Transcription', 'Transcription is the activity of creating a representation of a manuscript (often in combination with Enrichment) or of audio or video recordings. The representation is (also) generally textual for the verbal aspects of recordings and structured for example by speech turns, but can also contain multimodal information like gestures or events and multimedia information like time synchronization and relation to media files. Transcription that is partial, selective, and/or inherently linked to the source document may be better categorized as Annotation.'),
	(22, 2, 'Designing', 'The development of a user interface, with which the user is able to interact to perform various tasks and conduct activities. Also included here is the development of the user experience, where a person’s perceptions of the practical aspects such as utility, ease of use, and efficiency of the system are taken into consideration. Does not include the implementation of the design (see “Programming” or “Web development”). Database design is to be categorized using “Modeling”.'),
	(23, 2, 'Programming', 'Creation of code executable by a computer, that is creation of scripts or software. (This includes “Prototyping”, the creation of such code for testing or modeling purposes.) It is also closely related to the more broader activity of tool development. Programming is separate from Encoding (enriching a document by making structural, layout-related, semantic, or other information about a specific part of a document explicit by adding markup to its transcription).'),
	(24, 2, 'Translation', 'Translation involves creating a new linguistic object based on a source document but written in a different language than the source. This applies to both natural languages and machine-readable programming languages'),
	(25, 2, 'Web development', 'Creation of websites, by building on a platform (e.g. content management systems such as Drupal, WordPress and Omeka) or writing HTML/CSS. Writing a module/plugin for a platform, or programming web-based applications, should use the “Programming” method.'),
	(26, 2, 'Writing', 'Writing designates the activity of creating new texts (instead of capturing existing text). In our context, this would primarily concern research papers and reports, but may include other textually-oriented objects.'),
	(27, 3, 'Annotating', 'Annotating refers to the activity of making information about a digital object explicit by adding, e.g., comments, metadata or keywords to a digitized representation or to an annotation file associated with it. This can be in the form of annotations that comment on or contextualize a passage (explanatory annotations) in order to make structural or linguistic information explicit (structural/linguistic annotation), as linked open data making the relationships between objects machine-readable, or, in the case of general metadata, adding information about the object as a whole. Encoding is a technique associated with annotating, as are POS-Tagging, Tree-Tagging, and Georeferencing.'),
	(28, 3, 'Clean up', 'Data cleanup involves improving the quality of an existing digital object. This could include such things as correcting errors in a written text, errors in OCR results, debugging code, improving the quality of video, audio, or image file'),
	(29, 3, 'Editing', 'Editing refers to making structural, layout-related, semantic, or other information about a specific part of a document explicit by adding (inline or stand-off) markup to its transcription. This is typically part of the larger activity of scholarly editing of textual, musical, or other sources. It is based on a transcription of the document (the result of data recognition) and guided by a model of the document (the result of modeling).'),
	(30, 4, 'Content Analysis', 'Content Analysis is a method which aims to analyse aspects of digital objects relating to their meaning, such as identifying concepts or meaningful units. Relevant techniques include Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Information Retrieval, Discourse Analysis, but also Named Entity Recognition.'),
	(31, 4, 'Network Analysis', 'Network Analysis is a method to study the relations of (real or fictional) actors or other entities in a mediated network, which can take the form of a social or academic online network, a set of correspondence, or a work of literature; the resulting network is usually made up of nodes (entities) and edges (relations). Relevant techniques include Named Entity Recognition. When the artefacts themselves (texts, images, etc.) and their relations are concerned, the corresponding research activity would be Relational Analysis.'),
	(32, 4, 'Relational Analysis', 'Relational Analysis refers to computational techniques serving to discover specific relations between several objects of study. In textual studies, this could mean discovering overlap between several different texts (study of text reuse / plagiarism), or textual variations between several versions of one text (collation), or assessing the similarity of texts in terms of stylistic features (stylometry). By analogy, such methods can also be applied to other cultural artefacts, such as music, film or painting. Relevant techniques include Sequence Alignment, Collation, and techniques associated with Stylistic Analysis.'),
	(33, 4, 'Spatial Analysis', 'Relational Analysis refers to computational techniques serving to discover specific relations between several objects of study. In textual studies, this could mean discovering overlap between several different texts (study of text reuse / plagiarism), or textual variations between several versions of one text (collation), or assessing the similarity of texts in terms of stylistic features (stylometry). By analogy, such methods can also be applied to other cultural artefacts, such as music, film or painting. Relevant techniques include Sequence Alignment, Collation, and techniques associated with Stylistic Analysis.'),
	(37, 4, 'Structural Analysis', 'Structural Analysis involves analysis of objects on the level of the relations between structural elements of a cultural artefact (level of morphology or syntax in linguistics). Relevant techniques include: POS-Tagging, Tree-Tagging, Collocation Analysis, Concordancing.'),
	(38, 4, 'Stylistic Analysis', 'Stylistic Analysis consists of identifying stylistic or formal features of digital objects. Although computational stylistics is in many cases applied to texts and based on linguistic features, it can also be applied to other media such as physical artifacts, painting, music or movies. Relevant techniques include: Stylometry, Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Paleographic Analysis.'),
	(39, 4, 'Visualization', 'Visualization refers to activities which serve to summarise and present in a graphical form, and to use such graphical forms analytically, that is to detect patterns, structures, or points of interest in the underlying data. Virtually any kind of data can be visualized, and the forms of visualizations can be images, maps, timelines, graphs, or tables, and the like. Relevant techniques include plotting and mapping.'),
	(40, 5, 'Contextualizing', 'Contextualization is the activity of creating associations between an object of investigation and other, more established or better-understood objects in a relation of geographical, temporal, or thematic proximity to the object of investigation, with the aim of ascribing meaning to that object. Such contextualizing may build on existing annotations and/or metadata.'),
	(41, 5, 'Modeling', 'Modeling is the activity of creating an abstract representation of a complex phenomenon, usually in a machine-readable way, possibly in an interactive way (i.e. it includes “simulation”). Models become machine-readable when modelling produces a schema that describes the elements and the structure of an object of inquiry in an explicit way. Modeling can also refer to the activity of transforming or manipulating a digital object in such a way as to make it compatible with a previously constructed model or schema. Mapping, for instance, is an example of a spatial model. Workflow design is included as part of Modeling, using an object such as Process.'),
	(42, 5, 'Theorizing', 'Theorizing is a method which aims to relate a number of elements or ideas into a coherent system based on some general principles and capable of explaining relevant phenomena or observations. Theorizing relies on techniques such as reasoning, abstract thinking, conceptualizing and defining. A theory may be implemented in the form of a model, or a model may give rise to formulating a theory.'),
	(43, 6, 'Archiving', 'Archiving includes the process of moving data and other resources to a separate space for retention. If long-term archiving is involved, activities related to data preservation may also be involved.'),
	(44, 6, 'Identifying', 'Identifying refers to the activity of naming and/or assigning (possibly unique and/or persistent) identifiers to objects of enquiry or to any kind of digital object. Adding a metadata description of the object is part of Annotation'),
	(45, 6, 'Organizing', 'Organizing refers to the arrangement of objects (research materials, data sets, images, etc.) in a way that facilitates other research activities. May also include activities that support discovery such as metadata creation and enhancement.'),
	(47, 6, 'Preservation', 'The application of specific strategies, activities and technologies for the purpose of ensuring an accurate rendering of digital content over time. It facilitates the reuse of research data, objects, and related resources and may include activities related to sustainability and interoperability. Related techniques include but are not limited to: Bit Stream Preservation, Durable Persistent Media, Emulation, Metadata Attachment, Migration, Replication, Technology Preservation, Versioning, the use of Open Archival Information Systems and standards that support interoperability.'),
	(48, 7, 'Collaboration', 'Collaboration is involved in any research activity being done jointly by several researchers, possibly in different places and at different times. Research-oriented collaboration is enabled, particularly, through comprehensive Digital Research Environments, but can also happen around more specific activities, such as communication or sharing of resources.'),
	(49, 7, 'Commenting', 'Commenting is the activity of adding information to a piece of data, usually in a way that separates the data to which the comment is attached and the comment. It usually serves to express some opinion, to add contextual information, or to engage in communication or collaboration with others about the object commented on. This is different from Annotating (as defined here) which refers to adding descriptive or explanatory information to sections of an object with the aim of making inherent qualities, structures, or meanings of that section explicit.'),
	(50, 7, 'Communicating', 'Communicating refers to the activity of exchanging ideas with other people, primarily, but not exclusively, using linguistic means. Relevant techniques include Email, Chat, Audio-Conferencing'),
	(51, 7, 'Crowdsourcing', 'Crowdsourcing refers to the paradigm of user-generated content in a web 2.0 context, applied here to the domain of digital humanities research. Crowdsourcing may include gamification, which may be understood as one form of creating motivation in crowdsourcing endeavors.'),
	(52, 7, 'Publishing', 'Publishing refers to the activity of making any kind of object formally available to the wider public. This can involve objects of research, research data, research results, or tools and services. Publishing can be closed or open access / open source, and research results can be published in print or digital formats.'),
	(53, 7, 'Sharing', 'Sharing refers to the activity of making objects publically available through informal channels such as blogs, code sharing sites such as GitHUB, or other social media sites.'),
	(54, 60, 'Assessing', 'Assessing refers to the activity of verifying the existence of certain properties, usually indicative of some desirable quality in some outcome of an activity. This may refer to reviewing research papers or conference proposals, to evaluating the coherence of the annotation of audio-visual materials, or to an assessment of the usefulness of the Digital Humanities.'),
	(55, 60, 'Community Building', 'Community building is the activity of creating or enhancing a community with a common interest. It may include dissemination, teaching as well as advocating for specific activities, practices, or values.'),
	(56, 60, 'Give Overview', 'GiveOverview refers to the activity of providing information which is relatively general or provides a historical or systematic overview of a given topic. Nevertheless, it can be aimed at experts or beginners in a field, subfield or specialty.'),
	(57, 60, 'Project Management', 'Project management involves activities such as developing a strategy and assessing risk for conducting a project, as well as task management activities, such as keeping a record of tasks, due dates, and other relevant information. It may include activities such as planning, documenting, getting funding, but also sending reminders and status reports. Project Management is related to Collaboration.'),
	(58, 60, 'Teaching/Learning', 'Teaching and Learning involves one group of people interactively helping another group of people acquire and/or develop skills, competencies, and knowledge that lets them solve problems in a specific area of research.'),
	(59, NULL, 'Research Activities', 'Research activities are usually applied to one or several research objects. An article about modeling of manuscript properties would therefore be tagged with the tags “modeling” and “manuscript”. A plain text editor would be tagged with the tags "writing" and "code" and "text". '),
	(60, NULL, 'Meta Activities', 'Meta Activities are activities which, unlike regular research activities, do not apply directly to a research object, but rather to a combination of a research activity with a research object. A case in point would be a tutorial "teaching" the digital "encoding" of "music", or a report "introducing" readers to "pattern_recognition" in "images". Meta-Activity tags can be added to provide additional context to a typical activity+object pair of tags. In some cases, however, meta-activities may also apply to objects, for example in the case of objects like “infrastructure” or “digital_humanities”. ');
